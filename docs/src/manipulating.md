# Manipulating data

Besides the normal tracking workflow with `start`, `stop`, `pause` etc.,
*Track* provides a simple but comprehensive way to edit all kinds of underlying data.

All data is stored in human-readable formats.
Thus, it can be edited by letting *Track* open it as a temporary file in a text editor.
After editing the file, the user closes it to confirm.
*Track* checks the data for consistency, and only then overwrites any files.
