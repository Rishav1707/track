# Workspaces

Workspaces are a high-level way to group projects.

*Track* is always in one particular workspace, and all other workspaces are invisible.
Workspaces are completely independent and separated from one another.

The default workspace is `default`.

To create another workspace, use:

```shell
track create MyWorkspace
```

Switch workspaces with command `workspace`:

```shell
track workspace MyWorkspace
```
